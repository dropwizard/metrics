.. rubric:: *Getting Started* will guide you through the process of adding Metrics to an existing
            application. We'll go through the various measuring instruments that Metrics provides,
            how to use them, and when they'll come in handy.

.. _gs-maven:

Setting Up Maven
================

Just add the ``metrics-core`` library as a dependency:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.yammer.metrics</groupId>
            <artifactId>metrics-core</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Now it's time to add some metrics to your application!

.. _gs-gauges:

Gauges
======

A gauge is an instantaneous measurement of a value. For example, we may want to measure the number
of pending jobs in a queue:

.. code-block:: java

    Metrics.newGauge(QueueManager.class, "pending-jobs", new Gauge<Integer>() {
        @Override
        public Integer value() {
            return queue.size();
        }
    });

Every time this gauge is measured, it will return the number of jobs in the queue.

For most queue and queue-like structures, you won't want to simply return ``queue.size()``. Most of
``java.util`` and ``java.util.concurrent`` have implementations of ``#size()`` which are ``O(n)``,
which means your gauge will be slow (potentially while holding a lock).

.. _gs-counters:

Counters
========

A counter is just a gauge for an ``AtomicLong`` instance. You can increment or decrement its value.
For example, we may want a more efficient way of measuring the pending job in a queue:

.. code-block:: java

    private final Counter pendingJobs = Metrics.newCounter(QueueManager.class, "pending-jobs");

    public void addJob(Job job) {
        pendingJobs.inc();
        queue.offer(job);
    }

    public Job takeJob() {
        pendingJobs.dec();
        return queue.take();
    }

Every time this counter is measured, it will return the number of jobs in the queue.

.. _gs-meters:

Meters
======

A meter measures the rate of events over time (e.g., "requests per second"). In addition to the mean
rate, meters also track 1-, 5-, and 15-minute moving averages.

.. code-block:: java

    private final Meter requests = Metrics.newMeter(RequestHandler.class, "requests", "requests", TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    public void handleRequest(Request request, Response response) {
        requests.mark();
        // etc
    }

This meter will measure the rate of requests in requests per second.

.. _gs-histograms:

Histograms
==========

A histogram measures the statistical distribution of values in a stream of data. In addition to
minimum, maximum, mean, etc., it also measures median, 75th, 90th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th
percentiles.

.. code-block:: java

    private final Histogram responseSizes = Metrics.newHistogram(RequestHandler.class, "response-sizes");

    public void handleRequest(Request request, Response response) {
        // etc
        responseSizes.update(response.getContent().length);
    }


This histogram will measure the size of responses in bytes.

.. _gs-timers:

Timers
======

A timer measures both the rate that a particular piece of code is called and the distribution of its
duration.

.. code-block:: java

    private final Timer responses = Metrics.newTimer(RequestHandler.class, "responses", TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    public String handleRequest(Request request, Response response) {
        final TimerContext context = responses.time();
        try {
            // etc;
            return "OK";
        } finally {
            context.stop();
        }
    }

This timer will measure the amount of time it takes to process each request in milliseconds and
provide a rate of requests in requests per second.


.. _gs-healthchecks:

Health Checks
=============

Metrics also has the ability to centralize your service's health checks. First, implement a
``HealthCheck`` instance:



.. code-block:: java

    import com.yammer.metrics.core.HealthCheck.Result;

    public class DatabaseHealthCheck extends HealthCheck {
        private final Database database;

        public DatabaseHealthCheck(Database database) {
            super("database");
            this.database = database;
        }

        @Override
        public Result check() throws Exception {
            if (database.isConnected()) {
                return Result.healthy();
            } else {
                return Result.unhealthy("Cannot connect to " + database.getUrl());
            }
        }
    }

Then register an instance of it with Metrics:

.. code-block:: java

    HealthChecks.register(new DatabaseHealthCheck(database));

To run all of the registered health checks:

.. code-block:: java


    final Map<String, Result> results = HealthChecks.runHealthChecks();
    for (Entry<String, Result> entry : results.entrySet()) {
        if (entry.getValue().isHealthy()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " is healthy");
        } else {
            System.err.println(entry.getKey() + " is UNHEALTHY: " + entry.getValue().getMessage());
            final Throwable e = entry.getValue().getError();
            if (e != null) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

Metrics comes with a pre-built health check: ``DeadlockHealthCheck``, which uses Java 1.6's built-in
thread deadlock detection to determine if any threads are deadlocked.

.. _gs-jmx:

Reporting Via JMX
=================

All metrics are visible via **JConsole** or **VisualVM** (if you install the JConsole plugin):

.. image:: metrics-visualvm.png
    :alt: Metrics exposed as JMX MBeans being viewed in VisualVM's MBeans browser

.. tip::

    If you double-click any of the metric properties, VisualVM will start graphing the data for that
    property. Sweet, eh?


.. _gs-http:

Reporting Via HTTP
==================

Metrics also ships with a servlet (``AdminServlet``) which will serve a JSON representation of all
registered metrics. It will also run health checks, print out a thread dump, and provide a simple
"ping" response for load-balancers. (It also has single servlets--``MetricsServlet``,
``HealthCheckServlet``, ``ThreadDumpServlet``, and ``PingServlet``--which do these individual
tasks.)

To use this servlet, include the ``metrics-servlet`` module as a dependency:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.yammer.metrics</groupId>
        <artifactId>metrics-servlet</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.2</version>
    </dependency>

From there on, you can map the servlet to whatever path you see fit.

.. _gs-other:

Other Reporting
===============

In addition to JMX and HTTP, Metrics also has reporters for the following outputs:

* ``STDOUT``, using :ref:`ConsoleReporter <man-core-reporters-console>` from ``metrics-core``
* ``CSV`` files, using :ref:`CsvReporter <man-core-reporters-csv>` from ``metrics-core``
* Ganglia, using :ref:`GangliaReporter <manual-ganglia>` from ``metrics-ganglia``
* Graphite, using :ref:`GraphiteReporter <manual-graphite>` from ``metrics-graphite``
