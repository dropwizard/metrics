Metrics
=======

Metrics is a Java library which provides you with everything you need to
continuously measure your code's performance and behavior in its production
environment. It provides five different ways of measuring what your code is
doing: :ref:`gauges`, :ref:`counters`, :ref:`meters`, :ref:`histograms`, and
:ref:`timers`.

You can find the source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/codahale/metrics/>`_.
