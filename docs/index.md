**Metrics is a Java library which provides you with everything you need to
continuously measure your code's performance and behavior in its production
environment.**

Developed at [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/jobs) for continuous monitoring of
high-performance backend services, Metrics gives you critical insight into what
your code is doing, allowing to you identify performance bottlenecks or
regressions quickly and confidently.

If you're all about the big picture, you can start reading about the
[philosophy](philosophy.html) behind Metrics or get an [overview](overview.md)
of the Metrics project.

If you'd rather dive into the code, you should read our
[guide on getting started](getting-started.md) with Metrics.
