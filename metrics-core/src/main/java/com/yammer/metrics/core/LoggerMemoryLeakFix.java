/**
 * <p>Unbelievably, I had to write this damn class to reach deep into the guts of {@link Logger} and fix a memory leak
 * in the way it handles references to logger instances in Java 1.6.0_24 which get garbage collected. Come and gather
 * all around me and listen to my tale of woe.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link VirtualMachineMetrics} class does rather a lot of JMX-bothering on a regular basis. Every five
 * seconds, it gets GC information via JMX and calculates information about it. That is good. We like that. But as it
 * does so, JMX does all sorts of tracing behind the scenes from
 * {@link com.sun.jmx.mbeanserver.JmxMBeanServer#getAttribute(javax.management.ObjectName, String)}
 * to {@link com.sun.jmx.interceptor.DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor#getAttribute(javax.management.ObjectName, String)}
 * to {@link com.sun.jmx.interceptor.DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor#isTraceOn()}
 * to {@link com.sun.jmx.trace.TraceManager#isSelected(int, int)}
 * to {@link com.sun.jmx.trace.TraceManager#getLogger(int)} and finally to
 * {@link Logger#getLogger(String)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>All of that hoo-hah calls {@link Logger#setParent(java.util.logging.Logger)} rather a lot, which itself calls a
 * private method {@code doSetParent}, which among other things adds a {@link WeakReference} to the current
 * {@link Logger} to an {@link ArrayList} named {@code kids} in the parent {@link Logger}. This is all fine and good
 * except for one thing: nothing ever removes references whose referents have been garbage-collected from {@code kids}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>And so, over time, {@code kids} gets bigger and bigger and bigger until I see something like this in the heap of one
 * of my production services:</p>
 *
 * <p><img src="http://codahale.com/logger-memory-leak.png" /></p>
 *
 * <p>Yes, that's a full 10 <i>megabytes</i> of null {@link WeakReference}s in my heap. And it's growing… slowly…
 * unboundedly… constantly. After first spending a lot of time cursing the numbnuts at Oracle who decided that was a
 * totally appropriate way of doing things, I decided to get in touch with my old Ruby roots and just get all up in the
 * guts of someone else's code using reflection.</p>
 *
 * <p>And so, here you have a {@link Runnable} which {@link VirtualMachineMetrics} runs every 10 minutes or so which
 * goes through every single goddamn {@link Logger} instance that {@link LogManager} knows about, cracks open its
 * ribcage and rummages around inside until it finds both the {@code kids} field and the {@code treeLock} object it uses
 * for synchronization. It then locks the array and goes through it and removes all null {@link WeakReference}s,
 * ensuring that your heap will not eventually be replaced by </p>
 *
 * <p>This is a thing that a grown-up had to do. Never forget that.</p>
